## 📝 Description
This project combines Python for data cleaning & preprocessing and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard to analyze sales, profit, shipping costs, and product performance across categories.

The goal was to solve key business problems using data-driven insights and provide clear visual storytelling for decision-making.

## 🚀 Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Processing (Python)
#### - Used Pandas for handling missing values, data transformation.
#### - Used NumPy for numerical computations and feature engineering.
#### - Exported the cleaned dataset for visualization in Power BI.

### 2. Data Visualization (Power BI)
#### - Created dashboards with KPIs, trend analysis, and product-wise breakdowns.
#### - Applied DAX measures for custom metrics like monthly sales trends and profit margins.
#### - Built interactive slicers for category-level drilldowns.

## ❓ Business Problems Addressed

### 1. Which product categories generate the highest sales and profit?
### 2. Which products contribute most to quantity sold vs. revenue?
### 3. How do sales fluctuate across months and categories?
### 4. Which products incur the highest shipping costs?
### 5. How can discounts and shipping costs be optimized to improve profitability?

## 🔑 Key Insights & Solutions
## Category Performance
### -> Fashion is the leading category in total sales.
### -> Home & Furniture generates high profit margins despite lower sales compared to Fashion.
### -> Electronics shows relatively lower sales volume but steady demand.

## Top Products
### -> T-Shirts and Titak Watch lead in both sales and quantity sold.
### -> Sofas & Towels in Home & Furniture yield significant profits.

## Monthly Trends
### -> Sales remain stable around 650K – 690K, peaking in December (693K).
### -> Category drilldown shows seasonal buying trends (e.g., Fashion spikes during year-end).

## Shipping Costs
### -> Highest shipping costs observed in Shirts & Formal Shoes (32 units).

## Opportunity: optimize logistics for high-volume fashion items to reduce cost per unit.

## Profitability Opportunities
### Increasing focus on Home & Furniture could boost profit margins.
### Reducing shipping costs on Fashion products can significantly improve overall profitability.
